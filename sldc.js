// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the process of figuring out the needs and conditions of the project."
const design = "This step is where an outline of the project is created."
const implementation = "This step includes working on the building and installing of the software and getting it to do what it's supposed to do."
const testingAndIntegration = "This step checks to see if the project is working as developed and is meeting all of the requirements needed. Additional tests are completed as needed to ensure development is ready."
const maintain = "This step incorporates needed updates and repairs of the software to ensure it is running properly."
